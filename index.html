                    <h2>Women's Nutrition</h2>
					
					<p>The Wellness Center (1C-111) provides nutrition services such as weight loss and healthy eating programs. 
					Eating correctly allows you to maintain a healthy weight, increase energy and support your mood. For women, 
					eating an adequately healthy diet can help regulate your hormones and your menstrual cycle. As women reach 
					their age of puberty and throughout their childbearing years, certain nutritional needs should be met to 
					maintain health. These physical and hormonal changes in the body come with increased nutritional requirements 
					for certain vitamins and minerals Particularly, women are at higher risk of anemia and weakened bones, which 
					requires a higher intake of iron, calcium, magnesium, vitamin D and vitamin B9 (folate). Certain types of 
					birth control may also require you to add to these nutritional requirements. Additionally, if you regularly 
					smoke or drink, ask one of our nurses or nurse practitioners how this may affect your choice of birth control.</p>

                    <h2>STIs & HIV</h2>
					<p>Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) are important to be aware of when you are sexually active. Without 
					proper protection, STIs can be easily transmitted and harm people’s health. STIs aren't the only thing that 
					can transmitted through sex. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a dangerous syndrome that can be transmitted 
					via sexual activity. If HIV is not properly treated, it could lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDs). 
					AIDs can greatly affect someone’s life in the sense where it could shorten their lifespan. If HIV is treated in a 
					timely fashion, the progression to AIDs can be avoided and the treatment can allow someone to live the same amount 
					of years as someone who does not have HIV. <b>If you are sexually active, the Health & Wellness Services on campus 
					provides free HIV testing where you can get your result in twenty minutes. They also have tests for STIs.</b> It is 
					important to get tested and ensure you are not carrying the syndrome or STIs.</p>
