                    <h2>How long is a typical menstrual cycle?</h2>
					
					<p><b>Answer:</b>  A menstrual cycle is counted from the first day of a woman’s period up to 
					the first day of the next period. Typically, a menstrual cycle is 28 days long.

                    <h2>What is ovulation?</h2>
					<p><b>Answer:</b> Ovulation is when the ovary releases an egg that is able to be fertilized by sperm, 
					which causes pregnancy. Pregnancy is most likely in the three days before and up to ovulation if 
					a woman is not on birth control. </p>

                    <h2>How does my menstrual cycle affect my health?</h2>
					<p><b>Answer: </b>Your hormone levels change throughout your menstrual cycle, which can cause or exacerbate health problems. <br>
					<ul>
					<li><b>Anemia:</b> Heavy menstrual bleeding is the most common cause of iron-deficiency in women. Anemia is a condition that causes 
					you to feel tired and/or weak. Anemia happens when your blood cannot carry enough oxygen throughout your body due to the lack of iron.</li>
					<li><b>Asthma:</b> Your asthma symptoms may worsen during some parts of your menstrual cycle.</li>
					<li><b>Depression:</b> Symptoms of depression may worsen during your period. Women with a history of depression are more likely to have PMS
					or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).</li>
					<li><b>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS):</b> IBS causes cramping, bloating and gas. IBS symptoms may worsen right before your period.</li>
					<li><b>Problems getting pregnant:</b> Certain health problems such as endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome, being underweight, or obesity can 
					cause irregular periods. This can make getting pregnant more difficult.</li></p>
